### Cernox Consolidate
Cernox curves were originally written to Excel one sensor per worksheet.  I needed to put them all on one sheet.

Serial numbers across the top row
Leftmost column is temperature, the the remainder of the colums are resistance

Some curves had extra data points at 4.22 and 273.15 K -- remove those data points.  

Hard coded to look for an input file.  Writes to a .xlsx file.
