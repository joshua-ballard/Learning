# Population Finder

I saw this in an article about possible interview questions.  So, in my quest to learn Python, I attempted to solve it.  

As stated: 'Given a group of people with their birth years and death years, find the year with the highest population'

I assume that the set of people is a list of lists of the form:

  ```people = [ [birth_year, death_year],
       [birth_year, death_year],
       [etc.],```
