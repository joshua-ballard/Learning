# Learning

Here's where I'm keeping various learning projects.

----------

### [Population Finder](./PopulationFinder#population-finder)

Given a group of people with their birth years and death years, find the year with the highest population.

---------

### [Load Cell](./LoadCell#load-cell)

This was a work project compiling load cell serial numbers and calibration into a single document to be used for a data acquisition system.
