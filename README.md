Here's where I'm keeping various learning projects.

----------

### [Population Finder](./PopulationFinder#population-finder)

Given a group of people with their birth years and death years, find the year with the highest population.

### [Load Cell](./LoadCells#load-cells)

This was a work project compiling load cell serial numbers and calibration into a single document to be used for a data acquisition system.

---------

### [LakeShore to CryoCon](./LS_to_CCon#LS_to_CCon)
Convert LakeShore .dat files to CryoCon .crv files for Cernox sensors.

---------

### [Curve Offset](./CurveOffset#CurveOffset)
Add an offset to the resistance values in a cryocon calibration curve.

---------
### [Cernox Min Max](./Cernox_Min_Max#Cernox Min Max)
Find the min/max resistance from a spreadsheet of Cernox CurveOffset
